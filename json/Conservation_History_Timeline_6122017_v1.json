    "description": "The Mexican period brings a sharp drop in levels of national (centralized) political and economic activity on the northern frontier; weaker than Spanish national control. Local politics and economy become more important. The northern provinces become more isolated than under Spanish government. Mexican authorities lose control of the northern frontier. Mexicans resort to increased violence when dealing with Apaches. They eventually place bounties on Apaches and hire bounty hunters to bring in Apache scalps. Bounty hunters prey on peaceful rancherias, which are easy targets, more than on hostile Apaches. Some presidios, apparently, poison Apaches. Apaches generally become more hostile and retaliate more frequently against the Mexicans than they did against the Spanish. Revenge becomes an important driving force of hostilities. The frontier economy declines during these years. Military garrisons decrease in size. Civilian militias become more important, although largely ineffective. Economic support by the central government of the Apaches declines. Mexican communities frequently take hostages to use as advantage against the Apaches. Apaches do the same. Apaches frequently trade goods to one community that they take from another. Political confusion exists on the northern frontier. Mexicans become increasingly worried about a general Apache revolt.",

Levy is killed, and Gibson, Murphy, and Moyer escape into the Rincon Mountains and hide in Colossal Cave. They then move on to the Catalinas, then the Galiuros. They are captured and put in Pima County jail, where they are reported to have tricked and overpowered their jailer, George Cooler, leaving him tied up and gagged in their cell. They set six other prisoners free, and all escape. Within a month of the jailbreak, George Cooler pleads guilty to letting the prisoners go. Ultimately, Gibson, Murphy, and Moyer are recaptured and brought to trial on murder charges. Murphy and Moyer are found guilty—but Gibson is acquitted on the grounds that Levy was already dead when Gibson’s bullet hit him.",

They bring it to a halt by setting off explosives on the tracks, signaling with a red train lantern, and shooting the cars full of holes. Wells, Fargo Express Messenger Charles F. Smith barricades himself and the safe behind the locked door of the express car. The bandits force the engineer to carry a heavy explosive back to the express car and tell Smith to open the safe and get out or they will both be blown to kingdom come. Smith complies, and the robbers get away with about $3,000 in currency. \nAugust 10, 1887: Two of the robbers from the April holdup rob Train Number 20 again, between Pantano and Vail, this time making off with a considerable quantity of gold and Mexican silver dollars. \nAugust 16, 1887: Two caves are 'discovered' about 12 miles from Pantano by the posses scouring the area for the train robbers, who have escaped. Both caves are thought to have been used by the outlaws. Today, one, 'Five Mile Cave at Mountain Springs,' is Colossal Cave, and the other is probably a small shelter cave elsewhere in Colossal Cave Mountain Park. The bandits are thought to have rested at Mountain Springs [La Posta Quemada] Ranch and all the tracking parties use it as their headquarters.\nOctober 17, 1887: Two men attempt to rob a train about four miles east of El Paso, Texas. They are the same robbers; this time they are shot down by Wells Fargo Messenger J. Ernest Smith. The third bandit, who has been involved only in the first robbery, is apprehended and sentenced to serve five years in the Territorial Penitentiary in Yuma.",

Despite its good intentions, the policy is not effective in reducing overgrazing; the resulting damage on the range is due to the lack of control over cattle movement, to unpermitted cattle trespass, and to the lack of accurate data on the actual number of livestock on the range.",

    "description": "Early in its history, Arizona adopts the doctrine of prior appropriation to govern the use of surface water. This doctrine is based on the tenet of “first in time, first in right” which means that the person who first puts the water to a beneficial use acquires a right that has a higher priority than later appropriators of the water. Prior to June 12, 1919, a person could acquire a surface water right simply by applying the water to a beneficial use and posting a notice of the appropriation at the point of diversion. On June 12, 1919, the Arizona surface water code is enacted. Now known as the Public Water Code, this law provides that a person must apply for and obtain a permit in order to appropriate surface water unless: 1. The water is from the mainstream of the lower Colorado river, in which case a contract with the Secretary of the Interior is required. 2.The person or the person’s predecessor-in-interest, lawfully appropriated the water prior to June 12, 1919 and the person or the person’s predecessor-in-interest has filed a statement of claim for the appropriation with the state. 3.The water is stored in a stock pond constructed after June 12, 1919 and before August 27, 1977.",

Most are hoping to find employment in the farm fields in California. Those affected by the early economic downturn begin arriving in Arizona in 1930. A nation-wide drought and the resulting Dust Bowl drive even more westward during the mid-1930s. By then many earlier transients are leaving CA and migrating again eastward. This pattern of movement continues until the US economy recovers and employment rises dramatically as the country gears up for war in the early 1940s.",

    "description": "In the United States, the farm bill is the primary agricultural and food policy tool of the federal government. The comprehensive omnibus bill is passed every 5 years or so by the United States Congress and deals with both agriculture and all other affairs under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture. The farm bill is first created during the Great Depression to give financial assistance to farmers who are struggling due to an excess crop supply creating low prices, and also to control and ensure an adequate food supply. The first farm bill, known as the Agriculture Adjustment Act (AAA), is passed by Congress in 1933 as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The bill allows farmers to receive payment for not growing food on a percentage of their land as allocated by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. It also enables the government to buy excess grain from farmers, which can then be sold later if bad weather or other circumstances negatively affect output. The AAA also includes a nutrition program, the precursor to food stamps.",

When the CCC becomes active in Southern Arizona, Schmidt, the Pima County Board of Supervisors, the State Land Bureau, and the Tucson Chamber of Commerce unite in efforts to make Colossal Cave a public property. Schmidt gives up his State leases so that the area can be under the control of a government agency, and Colossal Cave becomes a State Park and is thus eligible to be a Civilian Conservation Corps Public Park Improvement Project. CCC Camp SP-10-A is authorized.",

The first CCC personnel to work at Colossal Cave are Company 0858. Originally from Wyoming, these CCC-ers are assigned to Camp SP-1-A at Randolph Park in Tucson in late October or early November, 1933. On May 5, 1934, instead of being transferred back to Wyoming for the summer, they are assigned duties at the new Colossal Cave state park. At first they continue to live at Camp SP-1-A and are driven back and forth to Colossal Cave each day. By February 1, 1935, they have set up a “fly camp” and are living in tents on La Posta Quemada Ranch immediately to the south of the Cave at Camp SP-10-A, the camp for the Colossal Cave Project.The men work on trails, handrails, and lighting in the Cave, and some construction of the barracks camp that follows them. In May of 1935, the fly camp is disbanded, and Company 0858 is transferred back to Camp SP-1-A, and from there to Wyoming. On August 19, 1935, Second Lieutenant J. Filbrun and twelve enrollees, forming a cadre from Camp NP-2-A, Grand Canyon, Arizona, arrive at Colossal Cave. First Lieutenant Alfred H. Johnson, the initial commander, greets the cadre. By August 22, 1935, enrollees from Texas and Arizona make up the company strength and Company 2851 is established at Camp SP-10-A. In the Cave, they widen passages, lay flagstone pathways, install handrails and lighting, and enlarge the entrance. Above ground, they construct the hewn-limestone retaining wall and Headquarters building, including the doors and shutters (and hardware) and furniture. After the work in the Cave and on the buildings is completed, the CCC personnel create the picnic areas; they build roads and several more stone structures, including the barbecue ramada in La Selvilla Picnic Area and the pumphouse.",

On September 13, 1933, the Soil Erosion Service is formed in the Department of the Interior, with Bennett as chief. The service is transferred to the Department of Agriculture on March 23, 1935, and is shortly thereafter combined with other USDA units to form the Soil Conservation Service by the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935. Hugh Bennett continues as chief, a position he holds until his retirement in 1952. On October 20, 1994, the agency is renamed to the Natural Resources Conservation Service as part of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994.",

The Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan (SDCP) guides regional efforts to conserve the best lands and most precious resources for future generations of Pima County residents to enjoy. The Plan combines short-term actions with long-range land-use decisions in Pima County, one of the most biologically diverse counties in the U.S. From cactus-studded deserts to conifer forests, the diverse landscape of Pima County is the home to a million residents from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and contains a rich diversity of plant and animal life.",

Acquisitions included the historic Posta Quemada Ranch, which is also the site of a 120-year old stagecoach station. Colossal Cave Mountain Park (CCMP) supports habitat for almost half of the bat species in the State of Arizona, including the endangered Lesser Long-nosed bat.

    "description": "The Empirita (little Empire) Ranch actually breaks off from the larger Empire Ranch in 1941. In 1991 and 92, the Pima County Flood Control District purchases 360 acres of the Empirita Ranch. In 2001, Pima County’s acquisition of the 2,700-acre Empirita property conserves the last remaining portions of the private land that comprised the historic Empirita Ranch. With assistance from the Arizona Land and Water Trust, the County negotiates the purchase of the Empirita property; additionally, the owner assigns the County its contractual right to withdraw up to 1,600 acre feet of groundwater annually from the Cienega Creek Basin. The Empirita acquisition expands upon already conserved reserves, including the Coronado National Forest, the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, and the County’s Bar V Ranch, Empirita Ranch, and Cienega Creek Natural Preserve.",

With the assistance of the Arizona Land and Water Trust, the County then acquires the Clyne Ranch parcels, located adjacent to the County’s Sands Ranch and also east of the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, totaling 880 acres. In addition, development restrictions are placed on 90 acres maintained by the seller. The ranch is an integral part of this assemblage of publicly-owned lands and further contributes to this corridor through the Cienega Valley. The Clyne Ranch parcels, like the Sands Ranch, contain high quality native grasslands found in the Sonoita Valley area.",

    "description": "At the Sanford Ranch, the Vails use the extensive floodplain for agricultural production; they plow a number of individual fields, each of which probably supports different crops. In 1892 Walter Vail expands agricultural endeavors to the riparian area near the Empire Ranch. Vail files a Desert Land claim on bottom lands 1/2 mile east of the corrals and around Empire Gulch. He conveys water during spring and summer months in a ¾ mile long ditch with numerous laterals to a broad flat area on the northeast and southwest sides of the Gulch. That irrigation system supports 250 fruit trees and five tons of corn, barley, and alfalfa annually. It also provides stock waters for the horse and newly-weaned calf herds.",
