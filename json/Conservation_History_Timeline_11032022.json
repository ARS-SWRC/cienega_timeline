The evidence of their use of the area include fields, pit houses, small hamlets, and villages along Cienega Creek. As people become less mobile, larger villages occur. Some of their activities are revealed in deeply buried sites below the modern surfaces.",

Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and three other men, one of whom was Esteban, a Moor, wandered alone through the southwest for many years. It is likely they travelled through SE AZ in early 1536. They met and were aided by many different native groups. In 1539, Fray Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan missionary, travelled through SE AZ with Esteban. Esteban reported that they were looking for Cibola, the City of Gold. It is possible that they entered through the area now known as the border town of Lochiel. According to Marcos, the many natives he met told him about the city. In 1540, Marcos leads Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and his expedition to rediscover it. The city of gold is never found; they do encounter Zuni pueblos in New Mexico.",

Anglo-American farmers, ranchers, and miners begin to occupy Sonoita Valley in 1856. The purchase (known in Mexico as Venta de La Mesilla, Sale of La Mesilla), is the last substantial territorial acquisition in the contiguous United States. The U.S. sought the land to provide a better route (less snow) for the construction of its southern transcontinental railway line. The Arizona portion of the Southern Pacific Railroad is built in 1880-1881.",

By May of 1934, the Colossal Cave Project has been authorized, and the CCC are on site, to spend four years there. The first CCC personnel to work at Colossal Cave are Company 0858. Originally from Wyoming, these CCC-ers are assigned to Camp SP-1-A at Randolph Park in Tucson in late October or early November, 1933. On May 5, 1934, instead of being transferred back to Wyoming for the summer, they are assigned duties at the new Colossal Cave state park. At first they continue to live at Camp SP-1-A and are driven back and forth to Colossal Cave each day. By February 1, 1935, they have set up a “fly camp” and are living in tents on La Posta Quemada Ranch immediately to the south of the Cave at Camp SP-10-A, the camp for the Colossal Cave Project.The men work on trails, handrails, and lighting in the Cave, and some construction of the barracks camp that follows them. In May of 1935, the fly camp is disbanded, and Company 0858 is transferred back to Camp SP-1-A, and from there to Wyoming. On August 19, 1935, Second Lieutenant J. Filbrun and twelve enrollees, forming a cadre from Camp NP-2-A, Grand Canyon, Arizona, arrive at Colossal Cave. First Lieutenant Alfred H. Johnson, the initial commander, greets the cadre. By August 22, 1935, enrollees from Texas and Arizona make up the company strength and Company 2851 is established at Camp SP-10-A. In the Cave, they widen passages, lay flagstone pathways, install handrails and lighting, and enlarge the entrance. Above ground, they construct the hewn-limestone retaining wall and Headquarters building, including the doors and shutters (and hardware) and furniture. After the work in the Cave and on the buildings is completed, the CCC personnel create the picnic areas; they build roads and several more stone structures, including the barbecue ramada in La Selvilla Picnic Area and the pumphouse.",

Most are hoping to find employment in the farm fields in California. Those affected by the early economic downturn begin arriving in Arizona in 1930. A nationwide drought and the resulting Dust Bowl drive even more westward during the mid-1930s. By then many earlier transients are leaving CA and migrating again eastward. This pattern of movement continues until the US economy recovers and employment rises dramatically as the country gears up for war in the early 1940s. New Deal programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Civil Work Program start in 1933 and hire unemployed on temporary basis. No work programs known to have occurred in Cienega Watershed though many in surrounding mountain ranges and communities.",

Beavers do not appear on archaeological faunal inventories of sites along Cienega Creek, but historically were likely present. Starting in 1825, beavers are trapped in the Gila and San Pedro watersheds. The 1894 Boundary Survey mentions that beaver are seen on the San Pedro River and on the Babocomeri Creek, but makes no specific mention of Cienega Creek. See Jeff Simms discussion in the Cienega Creek Shared History video Part 2. Interestingly long-time Vail resident Anne Gibson observed beaver in Rincon Creek as a child. It was when her father returned from WWII in and around 1945. 'There were beaver dams up and down Rincon Creek which helped to slow the water flow and allow for run off to seep into the two aquifers it (Rincon Creek) runs over.'",

The act is generally deemed a failure since 640 acres of grasslands in the West is still too small to raise sufficient livestock to make a living for one family.

Prior to June 12, 1919, a person could acquire a surface water right simply by applying the water to a beneficial use and posting a notice of the appropriation at the point of diversion. On June 12, 1919, the Arizona surface water code now known as the Public Water Code states a person must apply for and obtain a permit in order to appropriate surface water unless: 1) the water is from the mainstream of the lower Colorado river, in which case a contract with the Secretary of the Interior is required; 2) the person or the person’s predecessor-in-interest lawfully appropriated the water prior to June 12, 1919, and the person or the person’s predecessor-in-interest has filed a statement of claim for the appropriation with the state; 3) the water is stored in a stock pond constructed after June 12, 1919 and before August 27, 1977.",

The first farm bill, known as the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), was passed in 1933 as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The bill allows farmers to receive payment for not growing food on a percentage of their land as allocated by the Secretary of Agriculture.",

Bennett's motivation is based on his knowledge of the detrimental effects of soil erosion and the impacts on U.S lands that leads to the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. On September 13, 1933, the Soil Erosion Service is formed in the Department of the Interior, with Bennett as chief. The service is transferred to the Department of Agriculture on March 23, 1935, and is shortly thereafter combined with other USDA units to form the Soil Conservation Service by the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935. Hugh Bennett continues as chief, a position he holds until his retirement in 1952. On October 20, 1994, the agency is renamed Natural Resource Conservation Service as part of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. Today NRCS continues to provide education and assistance to individual land owners to manage and restore soils on their properties.",

The site is chosen for its quick access to the border region. Walter Vail, Herbert Hislop, and John Harvey, partners in the Empire Ranch, believe that they and their business will be more secure with a military fort only 30 miles away.

The Narragansett in upper McCleary Canyon produces 34,300 tons of copper ore and employs up to 270 miners during Ramsdell's ownership. Ramsdell runs the company store as well. The mine closes in 1918 when ore thins and value of copper declines at end of WW1. The mine has already produced 5M lbs of copper and 42,000 ozs of silver. Today the mine is part of the proposed Rosemont Mine development area in the NE Santa Rita Mountains.",

It is initiated on September 9, 1939, when Nazi Germany invades Poland and ends in Europe when Germany surrenders on May 8 1945 and in the Pacific when Japan surrenders on August 15, 1945, after the US drops a second nuclear weapon on the city of Nagasaki. Between 53 and 80 million people died during the war. The US enters the war in December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. In Southern Arizona, as with most of the rest of the country, people at home struggled with restrictions and rations on goods and materials -- gasoline, rubber and tires, metals such as wire for fencing. As with WW1, there was also a significant labor shortage with so many men oversees. Women and youth all stepped forward to fill those vacancies. Many men working in the food producing industries were exempt from service. Their contributions at home were deemed as important.",

      "description": "On December 20, 2012, through a joint news release, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the University of Arizona announce that pictures of a jaguar taken in late November of that year in the Santa Rita Mountains using camera-traps, are of the same individual photographed one year earlier. The camera-traps had been set by the Jaguar Survey and Monitoring Project, an initiative led by the University of Arizona. The cat’s unique spot pattern matches that of a male jaguar photographed by a hunter in the fall of 2011 in the Whetstone Mountains.This provides clear evidence that the big cats travel between southern Arizona’s “sky island” mountain ranges. A new ocelot photo is taken in the Huachuca Mountains November 20, 2012, four miles away from previous locations, by one of the UA project cameras. Again, comparisons of the spot patterns reveal this to be the same male ocelot that has been reported by the AGFD photographed in the Huachucas several times in 2011 and 2012. The jaguar had been listed for Federal protection in 1997 and the ocelot in 1982 under the Endangered Species Act. The presence of a Federally protected jaguar and ocelot in the area means that Federal actions, including Rosemont Mine, must take effects to the species into consideration.",

Arizona's Statehood Act gives title to all unreserved Sections 2, 16, 32 & 36 in each township for 'school sections' to be held in trust for support of the state's public school system or other state institutions either for sale or for lease. Most of those lands were only useful for grazing purposes. 10.5 Million acres of public domain land initiallly transfered to Arizona. Due to land trades between state and federal agencies, the State of Arizona holds the largest amount of land in the Cienega watershed. Most of those exchanges took place between 1915 and 1960. Often ranchers requested that the state claim those lands adjacent to their own properties so that the ranchers might have a good option to lease those lands for grazing. Today many of those state-owned properties are leased to ranchers at low cost for grazing purposes, including state lands within the LCNCA. Title of Section 16 (NW corner of Research Ranch) passes to the State.",

There his troops killed 19 citizens and burned the town. Under President W. Wilson's orders and with the permission of Mexico, General Pershing and 6000 troops pursued Villa inside Mexico for two years. He was not captured despite Pershing's use of trucks and aircraft for the first time by an American army. The presence of American troops inside Mexico led to resentment in local communities long remembered.",

Approximately half of the reach exhibits perennial stream flow. The quality of surface water in Cienega Creek is very good. A reach of the creek within the Preserve has been designated as a Unique Water of Arizona due in part to the excellent quality of the surface water. The stream channel is deeply incised. The Preserve is significant due to the presence of perennial stream flow and lush riparian vegetation, which creates an area with very high values for recreation, scenic quality, and wildlife habitat. The natural condition of the site also serves to facilitate groundwater recharge and to ameliorate the intensity of storm water runoff from the Cienega Creek basin, which drains into and through the Tucson metropolitan area. The significance of the Preserve is high as of a very few remaining examples of a desert riparian environment.",

It is the first national law to provide for regulated control of the unappropriated grazing land. The act is intended to help prevent overgrazing and erosion, improve rangeland conditions and regulate their use; lands are administered by the Department of the Interior. As amended, the law applies to approximately 162,000,000 acres inside grazing allotments. These can be vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved land from public lands, all except for Alaska, national forests, parks, monuments, Indian reservations, railroad grant lands, etc. Permits are given for grazing privileges in the districts, or to build fences, reservoirs, and other improvements. Permittees are required to pay a fee; permit cannot exceed ten years but is renewable. Permits can be revoked because of severe drought or other natural disasters that deplete grazing lands.The act also ends the opportunity to claim a homestead, when the remaining unappropriated lands come under federal control. Most importantly, it ends the opportunity to graze livestock for free on federal lands.",

      "description": "The Arizona Game and Fish Department introduces non-native species, including fish, crayfish, and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) for food and for sport purposes starting in the 1920s. Bullfrogs compete with and often prey upon many aquatic species and have detrimental effects on native fish and amphibian populations including on protected native species, such as the Chiricahua leopard frog and Mexican garter snake. Bullfrogs are also very adept at natural dispersal over significant distances from occupied sites via perennial streams, intermittent streams, or over land. It is not until the 1980s that scientists determine that bullfrogs have contributed to the loss of native fish, frogs, and snakes. Researchers determine that bullfrogs are also eating a wide range of species such as bats and birds. University of Arizona scientists, including Drs. Cecil Schwalbe and Phil Rosen, develop programs to eliminate bullfrogs, with extensive programs in Pima County at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, and beginning in 2002 in the Cienega Creek Watershed. Bullfrogs are first observed in Empire Valley in 1986, according to Rosen and Schwalbe, after being introduced into a livestock pond, and apparently, dispersing into Cienega Creek.",

During the Great Depression this program provides important funds to ranchers struggling with cattle loss, range degradation, drought and the livestock market collapse. Today the National Resources Conservation Service works with individual ranchers to plan and manage their rangelands including erosion control and recovery from drought years.

Overgrazing by excessive numbers of cattle removes protective grasses throughout valleys and along the streambanks. Over the 28 months of the drought, tens of thousands of cattle die from thirst and starvation. The result of holding too many animals for too long under severe drought conditions is the permanent loss of topsoil and important grass species, and the lowering of the water table. The ecological destruction and financial losses drive some but not all ranchers to change their breeding and shipping patterns and management of grass and water in order to reduce the potential for future drought disasters. At Empire Ranch, most animals are removed to other states. By the end of drought in July 1893, only 2000 animals left on Empire ranges.",

White records descriptions of natural resources, landmarks, human habitations, roads, and locations and distances between. Using descriptions and precise measurements, he draws first detailed map of each township. These maps are published in the General Land Office and used later by homesteaders and miners to make individual claims. No claims can be filed until a formal survey has been made. With these surveys of the watershed, settlement of the valley by ranchers and farmers accelerates.",

Just a few miles away in Bavispe, Sonora, adobe buildings are in ruins, and 40 people are killed. In Arizona, it breaks up playas and forms the Mustang Mountains skyline later used in Red River film. The earthquake changes underground water flows and creates many springs. It initiates major fires in all Southeast Arizona mountain ranges from falling rocks. Chimneys at the Empire Ranch collapse. It is reported from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Phoenix, and from Yuma to Santa Fe, New Mexico. May 30, 1887: Tombstone reports significant aftershock. Other significant aftershocks occur August 27, 1887, and November 11, 1887, which is the second aftershock in two weeks, and cracks wooden depot buildings in Pantano.",

Range managers institute a policy of 'transfer reductions', requiring a 10% reduction in permitted numbers of livestock each time a permit is transferred to a new permittee. Despite its good intentions, the policy is not effective in reducing overgrazing; the resulting damage on the range is due to the lack of control over cattle movement on and off the allotments, to unpermitted cattle trespass, to the lack of accurate data on the actual number of livestock on the range, and a lack of understanding of the real carrying capacity of the grasslands, i.e. the remaining amount of grass after grazing needed to support the next season's growth.",

Sanford’s brother, Franklin, claims land two miles south in the area now known as the Ag Fields. Sanford brings his fiancé, Louisa Bloxton, and her brothers, John and Robert, to join his Cienega settlement later in the same year. All homestead or purchase lands along the Creek and claim water rights. Their claims provide the family with some of the richest grazing and tillable lands within Cienega Valley. Their family control of land and water in the middle Cienega Valley area essentially excludes any competing ranching enterprise.Sanford sells all of the family lands in the upper Cienega to Walter Vail in 1882. Don takes over brother Denton Sanford's ranch in Patagonia following his brother's death.",

Like Don Sanford, the Vails use the extensive floodplain for agricultural production; they plow a number of individual fields, each of which probably supports different crops. In 1892 Walter Vail expands agricultural endeavors to the riparian area near the Empire Ranch. Vail files a Desert Land claim on bottom lands 1/2 mile east of the corrals and around Empire Gulch. He conveys water during spring and summer months in a ¾-mile-long ditch with numerous laterals to a broad flat area on the northeast and southwest sides of the Gulch. That irrigation system supports 250 fruit trees and five tons of corn, barley, and alfalfa annually. It also provides stock waters for the horse and newly-weaned calf herds.",

In addition, other species benefit from the plant richness and shelter that burrows offer. The Approved Las Cienegas Resource Management Plan and Record of Decision prescribes reintroduction of the black-tailed prairie dog. In 2008 AGFD begins establishing colonies at Las Cienegas; in 2015 this expands to three colonies, and in 2017, prairie dogs are released at the Sands Ranch.",

Till now, Pima County has been leasing the property. At the same time, they purchase the adjoining historic La Posta Ranch, also the site of a stagecoach station dating to the mid-1870s, and additional acreage. This combines Colossal Cave Park and La Posta Quemada Ranch and formally establishes Colossal Cave Mountain Park (CCMP), now about 2,400 acres. The non-profit Pima County Parklands Foundation takes over La Posta Quemada Ranch’s State grazing leases,to use the 5,714 acres to protect the boundaries of the new mountain park. Pima County Parklands Foundation also takes over administration of CCMP, and Joe and Martie Maierhauser continue as Park operators for the Foundation. CCMP supports habitat for almost half of the bat species in the State of Arizona, including the endangered Lesser Long-nosed Bat. CCMP also protects large segments of lush riparian vegetation along Posta Quemada Wash and Agua Verde Creek, a major tributary to Cienega Creek.",

      "description": "Using both 1997 and 2004 voter-approved bond funds for open space acquisitions, Pima County purchases five properties. The significance in these acquisitions is the expansion of the link between Colossal Cave Mountain Park (CCMP) and Cienega Creek Natural Preserve. The properties are:\n1 - Akers/Dailey Properties: in August 1999, the Board of Supervisors approves acquisition of the Akers/Dailey parcels totaling 158 acres for $1,122,720. The significance of the acquisitions is not only building a link towards the Cienega Creek Natural Preserve, but also the protection of natural floodplain functions, an Important Riparian Area and wildlife corridor.\n2 – Bradley property: Also in August 1999, the Board of Supervisors approves acquisition of the 40-acre Bradley property for $266,036. This adds to the linkages towards the Cienega Creek Natural Preserve and protection of natural floodplain functions, an Important Riparian Area and wildlife corridor.\n3 - Alpher Property: In January 2000, the County purchases the 147-acre Alpher property for $514,412. The property expands CCMP’s eastern boundary, protecting upstream water sources and habitat for the endangered Lesser long-nosed bat.\n4 - Cates Property: In May 2006, the County purchases the 39-acre Cates property for $132,957. The parcel’s location south of CCMP and its proximity to the County’s Baker property, acquired for Cienega Creek Natural Preserve, makes it a strategic acquisition; it supports habitat for Lesser long-nosed bat and Mexican long-tongued bat.\n5 - Knez Property: In August 2006, the County acquires the 80-acre Knez property for $240,967. This property connects to the Cates property to expand conserved lands adjacent to CCMP, and expands the connection between CCMP and the Cienega Creek Natural Prese",

The proposed mine is located on private and Forest Service (FS) lands in the Barrel drainage on the Nogales Ranger District. The project would consist of an open pit, a processing plant (mill) and associated facilities, and waste rock and tailings facilities, with a total surface disturbance of an estimated 5,888 acres of combined private lands, lands administered by Arizona State Land Department (ASLD), and FS lands. In February 2008, Rosemont supplies a supplemental preliminary MPO which is accepted by CNF for environmental review. Associated with the mine are: electrical transmission and distribution lines, water supply lines, and transportation needs along State Hwy 83. The project would mine copper, silver, and molybdenum but mainly copper (estimated at 5.88 billion pounds of copper, 194 million pounds of molybdenum, and 80 million ounces of silver.",

They are captured and put in Pima County jail, where they are reported to have tricked and overpowered their jailer, George Cooler, leaving him tied up and gagged in their cell. They set six other prisoners free, and all escape. Within a month of the jailbreak, George Cooler pleads guilty to letting the prisoners go. Ultimately, Gibson, Murphy, and Moyer are recaptured and brought to trial on murder charges. Murphy and Moyer are found guilty—but Gibson is acquitted on the grounds that Levy was already dead when Gibson’s bullet hit him.",

Smith barricades himself and the safe behind the locked door of the express car. The bandits force the engineer to carry a heavy explosive back to the express car and tell Smith to open the safe and get out or they will both be blown to kingdom come. Smith complies, and the robbers get away with about $3,000 in currency. August 10, 1887: Two of the robbers from the April holdup rob Train Number 20 again, between Pantano and Vail, this time making off with a considerable quantity of gold and Mexican silver dollars. August 16, 1887: Two caves are \"discovered\" about 12 miles from Pantano by the posses scouring the area for the train robbers, who have escaped. Both caves are thought to have been used by the outlaws. Today, one, \"Five Mile Cave at Mountain Springs,\" is Colossal Cave, and the other is probably a small shelter cave elsewhere in Colossal Cave Mountain Park. The bandits are thought to have rested at Mountain Springs [La Posta Quemada] Ranch and all the tracking parties use it as their headquarters.\nOctober 17, 1887: Two men who have been using caves outside of El Paso, Texas, as a hideout, attempt to rob a train about four miles east of El Paso. They are the same robbers; this time they are shot down by Wells Fargo Messenger J. Ernest Smith. The third bandit, who has been involved only in the first robbery, is apprehended and sentenced to serve five years in the Territorial Penitentiary in Yuma.",

Repeated droughts in Arizona kill thousands of livestock through starvation and dehydration. Always hoping for rain, many ranchers retain their animals too long on already denuded grasslands.

Bell reworks the agricultural fields in 1972; he plows all of the fields to one level and excavates a two-mile-long ditch -- now called the Grand Canal. Soil excavated from the Canal is used to build the raised roadway (#6901) that today parallels the Canal. Bell creates a temporary berm with sandbags at the southern end of the field to divert Cienega Creek flood waters into the Canal during summer rains. Immediately downstream of that berm is a road with culvert that crosses the reduced Creek; the road provides access to the Cienega Ranch. Bell’s redirection of floodwaters initiates significant erosion downstream in Matty Canyon, Canal enlargement, and other flooding problems near the agricultural fields.",

These historic agricultural fields were originally developed by Don Sanford and later used by Walter Vail, Frank Boice, Jack Greenway and Sam Bell for cattle and horse fodder. This restoration and stabilization project redirects the Cienega Creek back into its original channel and permits an unfettered flow in the Creek again. The marshlands, once extensive even in 1936, had been reduced to small half-acre remnant east of the Grand Canal, as a consequence of the long history of agricultural modifications. The new Creek-crossing roadway is moved downstream ¼ mile and rebuilt as a concrete slab designed to have minimal impact to Creek flows. The BLM has situated a public campsite in a portion of the Ag Fields.",

When the CCC becomes active in Southern Arizona, Schmidt, the Pima County Board of Supervisors, the State Land Bureau, and the Tucson Chamber of Commerce unite in efforts to make Colossal Cave a public property. Schmidt gives up his State leases so that the area can be under the control of a government agency, and Colossal Cave becomes a State Park and is thus eligible to be a Civilian Conservation Corps Public Park Improvement Project.

It is part of a larger vision for restoring miles of banks along Cienega Creek and Pantano. This specific project aims for restoring 5 acres in Township 16 South, Range 17 East, Section 35. Restoration goals are to restore plant diversity to an area that had been cleared of mesquite. In August 1996, volunteers plant 600 seedlings of sacaton grass. Funded through a wildlife grant, the project also experiments with tall pot revegetation to ensure that plants are well-watered. At restoration, some mesquite trees are coming back naturally. Some additional mesquite are planted but with the focus on diverse vegetation, the project adds hackberry, gray thorn acacia, catclaw, sacaton, elderberry and little leaf sumac. It is a restoration success.",

They bring livestock with them as a travelling food source and means of transport. The assembly probably enters AZ travelling down the San Pedro River; they turn NE through Government Draw Pass and Apache Pass and into New Mexico. This 'entrada' is likely to be the first time that European livestock are in Southeast Arizona.

Ranchers use those distances between watering sites to keep out other livestock from ‘their’ grasslands.

The act requires that a developer verify he has secured physical, legal, and continuous access to a 100-year supply of water. The act designates four parts of the state where groundwater pumping is heaviest as Active Management Areas (AMAs). The management plans outline conservation goals and methods for various groundwater users in the agricultural, industrial, and municipal sectors. The GMA prohibits the transfer of water between different AMAs, but mine companies and mine operations are exempt. A decision is made to exclude area of Rosemont mine (then owned by ASARCO) from the Tucson AMA and also exclude portions of Davidson Canyon.",

Citizens volunteer to work with Audubon staff on recording avian sightings in Lower Cienega Creek.

Civilian militias become more important, although largely ineffective. The Mexican government loses control of the northern frontier and unable to curb the increased violence from Apaches. The government places a bounty on Apaches and hires bounty hunters to bring in Apache scalps. Bounty hunters prey on peaceful rancherias, which are easy targets, more than on hostile Apaches. Some presidios, apparently, poison Apaches. Apaches retaliate more frequently against the Mexicans. Revenge becomes an important driving force of hostilities. Economic support by the central government of the Apaches declines. Mexican communities frequently take hostages to use as advantage against the Apaches. Apaches do the same. Apaches frequently trade goods to one community that they take from another. Political confusion exists on the northern frontier. Mexicans become increasingly worried about a general Apache revolt.",

Around us grew the maguay, the yucca, and various kinds of cacti, together with small oaks ; while beneath us, the valley spread out from six to eight miles rn width, and some twelve or fifteen in length. Unlike the desolate and barren plains between the mountain ridges, which we had crossed between the Rio Grande and the San Pedro, this valley was covered with the most luxuriant herbage, and thickly studded with live oaks; not like a forest, but rather resembled a cultivated park.

He goes on: 'Having but incidentally spoken of the Natural History of the countries I passed through, I now propose to give some brief notices of the most remarkable animals that were seen time to time...In the mountains and along the water-courses, where there are more or less forest trees and shrubbery, both quadrupeds and birds are found in greater variety. Among the former may be mentioned the leopard, cougar, ocelot, lynx, panther; the brown, black, and grizzly bear; the fox, antelope, and various kinds of deer; the large wolf (lobo), and the coyote, raccoon, skunk, marmot, weasel! a great variety of moles, rats, and mice, which harbor in the ground; hares rabbits, squirrels, Rocky Mountain Sheep, etc.'",

They were as tame and unsuspicious as the Peeps, and, when startled, got up with a peet, peet, not a little resembling the familiar notes of those birds. These marshy places appeared to be the only resorts in the neighborhood ; for after being absent for a few moments they invariably returned to the same spots, and resumed their feeding.'",

It appears in fall to resemble in its manners the Downy Woodpecker: and its notes, too, are similar. It is by no means an inhabitant of the mountains, but shuns them, and seeks' the warm valleys, in the deciduous trees of which it spends the time actively moving over the branches, spending more time among them than on the main trunks, and now and then descending to the ground. Wherever are found large areas in which is a heavy growth of the mesquite trees, this species may always be looked for with perfect confidence, as these trees of all others attract their attention.'",

Lateral valleys, here and there connected with the main one and the hills between, besides being well covered with the above-named grasses, had oak, pine, and mesquite clumps, the whole combining into a landscape of more than usual attractiveness. In addition to this, a small stream ran through the valley, supplying enough of water for all purposes except irrigation. The valley gradually narrows into a cañon, and then \"heads out\" on a ridge, which once crossed, we were again in the Cienega, but much nearer its head.",

      "description": "ASARCO and Coronado National Forest sign a Memorandum of Understanding to initiate Land Exchange. In the mid to late 1990s, land exchanges between federal agencies with mining companies resulted in several signed Memoranda. ASARCO wanted to consolidate its mining properties and access in the Rosemont area; CNF and other agencies wanted to solve access problems to federal lands or preserve natural and cultural resource areas. In exchange for 13,272 acres at Rosemont, Coronado National Forest would have acquired 2,222 acres in Madera Canyon, Happy Valley, Rucker Canyon and Cochise Stronghold. This land exchange was strongly denounced by local and private organizations and the exchange was withdrawn in February 1998.",

It burns 47,000 acres (186 sq km), including 12,000 acres (49 sq km) on Las Cienegas National Conservation Area. Many cottonwoods along the Empire Gulch and Cienega Creek are severely affected. Impacts to Las Cienegas include impacts to vegetation, to habitat for threatened and endangered species like the Chiricahua Leopard Frog and Yellow-Billed Cuckoo, damaged range and recreational structures. Later BLM treats soils, removes damaged trees, and replaces signs and cattle guards. Over 100 people are evacuated and total damage amounts to about $8 million. Over 600 firefighters are engaged. The fire starts when a father shoots into a target to reveal the gender of the expected baby (a boy). Dennis Dickey pleads guility and under a plea agreement, agrees to a sentence of five years’ probation and restitution totaling more than $8.1 million. He agrees to make an initial $100,000 payment and monthly payments thereafter.",

Indicators are grouped into landscape, riparian, upland, and socio-cultural areas. To meet the criteria for a good indicator, it must: measure impacts of change (human, climate, etc.) and the thresholds that threaten ecosystem integrity; produce useful information for management in the short and long term; be repeatable, comparable, consistent, simple/cost effective to collect; be able to expose threats and vulnerabilities; be quantifiable, transferable, and applicable to management across jurisdictions; use data already or readily available; and use data that speaks to the public.",

The US entered the war on April 6 1917 after Germany sank 7 US merchant ships. During the war, food, gasoline, and many materials were rationed and in short supply. With the demand to feed US troops abroad and later the populations in devastated European countries, the US government encouraged ranchers to buy and raise more livestock and farmers to put more land under cultivation. These misguided efforts led to serious overgrazing on private and public lands and the destruction of thousands of acres of arid grasslands that could not support crops. After the war, the US entered a 3-year long recession. Many returning vets suffered severe lung afflictions from the effects of mustard gas or tuberculosis. Large numbers of vets and their families moved to Arizona seeking a dry climate where they could breathe more easily and recover from their physical and psychological traumas.",

Early assessments by range surveyors indicate that forest grasslands are already carrying too many animals. The Forest Service instigates a policy of grazing permits for chosen ranchers. Later each permittee is allowed access to specific fenced areas (allotments) for a specified number of livestock. A policy of transfer reductions requiring a 10 percent reduction in the number of allowed animals with each transfer of the permit to a new owner is implemented in 1907 to slowly ease the amount of overgrazing. This automatic reduction policy is ended in 1953. Since then animal reductions are only imposed in order to improve range conditions.",

The maize pollen is detected in a stratigraphic unit dated to the preceramic San Pedro archaeological phase about 800 BC (3000 BP). Later excavations (Huckell p.132) find carbonized maize at archaeological site EE: 2:35. The presence of maize in these deposits does not indicate that local populations are dependent on domestic crops but suggest maize is being included in the highly productive wild foods present in the area.",

In summer and fall: acorns and walnuts, chenopod, amaranth, purslane and horse purslane greens and seeds, caryopses (grass seeds), juniper berries, wild grapes, mesquite pods. Foraging further would have opened higher elevation conifer forest or more arid plant zones like saguaro.",

The fire burns 28% (12,000 acres or 48.562 sq. km.) of land in the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, including significant riparian areas within Empire Gulch and Cienega Creek, and increases threat to endangered fish, amphibians, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, and Huachuca water umbel. The fire re-burns 1,800 acres (7.284 sq. km.) of the 2011 Greaterville Fire, 2/3 of the 2015 Oak Tree Fire (2,023 acres or 8.287 sq. km.), the 2012 Empire Fire (148 acres or 0.599 sq. km.), and the 2016 Hilton Fire (163 acres or 0.66 sq. km.). Large amounts of flammable biomass due to heavy 2016 monsoon rains produce ideal conditions for a massive fire. The fire severity is highest in the western part of the fire (33% with 90% canopy mortality). In the eastern half, 41% saw little or no canopy mortality.",

      "description": "The Florida Fire, which burns 23,201 acres (93.891 sq. km.), is caused by a lightning strike on Florida Peak in Santa Rita Mountains. Fire burns down the eastern slopes of Santa Rita Mountains and later spills over onto west side. Area has not burned to any significant degree since the 1950s. Terrain, almost vertical in higher elevations, presents major challenges to firefighting. Surrounding areas--Madera Canyon, Box Canyon, Gardner Canyon, Greaterville area---are all closed to access: Later Madera Canyon homeowners and investigators on Mount Hopkins telescopes are evacuated as fire surges south and west. At peak of containment effort: about 1,000 personnel (16 elite hot shot crews, 6 - 20-person teams, 7 helicopter tankers to deliver retardant, 27 fire engines, 6 bulldozers) are involved. Final cost of control: $6.5M. Only the arrival of monsoon rains on July 18 stems the continuing rapid expansion of fire lines. After a year, major portions of Santa Rita National Forest remain closed due to hazardous soil and vegetation conditions.",

We had the hardest storm last Friday and Saturday that we have had this season. The rain and hail struck me before I got to the horse corral and could not get any farther and could not cross the river. When I got home the next morning, I found part of the roof off my shed. The whole upper field had been under water over the corn, barley and wheat. The levy had withstood all the storms until this one. It took the levy and all the fence from the corral to the ditch, trees and all, except the 2 largest at the ditch. Washed out the RR so we have no trains.”",
